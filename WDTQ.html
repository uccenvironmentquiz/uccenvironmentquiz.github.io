<h1> Why Do The Quiz? </h1>
<hr> 

<p> It is apparent that every year the earthâ€™s resources become more and more depleted and the climate continues to change. Therefore, there are two crucial reasons why our quiz should be completed. Oftentimes people are unaware of what simple actions have a negative effect on the environment. By completing the quiz, we are able to inform students on what specific habits they currently participate in contribute to a less sustainable future and how those habits can change to create a much more positive effect on the environment. Furthermore, the quiz acts as a tool that is able to calculate the current impact that us, the students at UCC, have on the environment. Thus, from the information that will be obtained from the participants in the quiz, crucial decisions surrounding sustainability can be made with more accuracy. </p>

<p> In the year 2005, the city of Calgary conducted a similar survey to the one that we created with the goal of collecting information on the prevalence of habits that are negative to the environment in the city. After the residents completed the survey, it was uncovered that they were consuming resources at a rate that was incredibly unsustainable and their ecological footprint was much higher than the footprint of the average Canadian resident. After obtaining this information, Calgary has improved their harm on the environment through many different initiatives and policy changes. </p>

<p> Like Calgary, it is possible that students at Upper Canada College have a large ecological footprint and through the completion of the quiz, specific routines that contribute to this devastating effect will be prevalent to the school. </p>
